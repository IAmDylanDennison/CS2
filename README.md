# CS2
All the work I have completed in the class Computer Science 2 at Kent State with Dr. Maletic.
This is the class where I really learned how to code. This class was extremely challenging with the 2nd highest fail rate at Kent state university.
The topics included Data structures. We created/implemented them as well. Created our own string class, linked list, map and more. 
Challenging yet rewarding for a new programmer.

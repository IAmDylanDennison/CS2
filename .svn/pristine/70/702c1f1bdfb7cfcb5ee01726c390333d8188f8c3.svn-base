I think the bubble sort function is the problem with the runtime. Bubble sort
must access the vector and the large number of calls in the function will 
cause the runtime to be longer. I think that is the main reason at least. 
I am not sure on how it is fixable but I think the main reason of the lab was
to indicate the reason for the runtime statistics.
